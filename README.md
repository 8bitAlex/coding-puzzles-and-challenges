# Coding Puzzles and Challenges

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/8bitalex/coding-puzzles-and-challenges/gradle.yml)

Welcome to my curated collection of coding problems, data structures, and algorithmic challenges.

This repository serves as both a **portfolio** and a **technical interview prep resource**.  
It contains:
- Implementations of coding puzzles and algorithm challenges
- Executable examples in **Java 17** with **Gradle**
- Unit tests (JUnit) to validate correctness
- Occasional experiments with data structures and design patterns

Thank you for your interest in my work and I hope you find some insight and maybe a bit of fun.
